# Preparing-for-Junior-Dev.-Position
HackerRank Progress
I am currently preparing myself for a junior software development position. On the side I use resources like hackerrank to practice concepts that I learn from school and apply them in real examples.
Some of the resources I use include but are not limited to: 
1. [A comprehensive list of resources from Google.]
