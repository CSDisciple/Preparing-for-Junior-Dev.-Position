# Preparing-for-Junior-Dev.-Position
 Progress

I am completely new to software engineering and decided to take on the world of problem solving. I am intrigued by artificial intelligence, machine learning, website development as well as the process of creating software that controls tangible things aka robotics.

My knowledge as of 12/21/2016, I currently possess basic Java skills which I can incorporate into different languages if need be.
Some of the basic concepts that I have acquired on my own and enhanced in my structured CS classes, are: Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism, Overriding vs Overloading, Encapsulation, OOP, Data Structures, Exception Handling and Event Driven Programming.

Listed concepts will be posted on GitHub to back up my claims.

Main resources I use to learn the basics of computer science and software engineering are:HackerRank, Bloomberg Codecon, Coursera, Introduction to Algorithms by CLRS and another book by Sedgewick.I use many different resources when a question arises, however; these are the main sources where I learn algorithm design, implementation, Big-O notation and programming languages.

As of May 2017 I received an offer for a summer internship from Fidelity Investments. I finished it in August and walked away with a lot more diverce experience than I ever expected. I have a lot of work ahead of me, I need to deplete the HackerRank website problem sets, finish bloomberg code con, finish intro. to algorithms by clrs, pie and cracking the coding interview. All of this and much much more to hopefully one day be able to help and solve real world problems.
