# Preparing-for-Junior-Dev.-Position
 Progress

I am completely new to software engineering and decided to take on the world of problem solving. I am intrigued by artificial intelligence, machine learning, website development as well as the process of creating tangible material.
My knowledge as of 12/21/2016, I currently possess basic Java skills which I can incorporate into different languages if need be.
Some of the basic concepts that I have acquired on my own and enhanced in my structured CS classes, are: Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism, Overriding vs Overloading, Encapsulation, OOP, Data Structures, Exception Handling and Event Driven Programming.

Listed concepts will be posted on GitHub to back up my claims.
