# Preparing-for-Junior-Dev.-Position
 Progress

I am completely new to software engineering and decided to take on the world of problem solving. I am intrigued by artificial intelligence, machine learning, website development as well as the process of creating software that controls tangible things aka robotics.

My knowledge as of 12/21/2016, I currently possess basic Java skills which I can incorporate into different languages if need be.
Some of the basic concepts that I have acquired on my own and enhanced in my structured CS classes, are: Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism, Overriding vs Overloading, Encapsulation, OOP, Data Structures, Exception Handling and Event Driven Programming.

Listed concepts will be posted on GitHub to back up my claims.

Main resources I use to learn the basics of computer science and software engineering are:HackerRank, Bloomberg Codecon, Coursera, Introduction to Algorithms by CLRS and another book by Sedgewick.I use many different resources when a question arises, however; these are the main sources where I learn algorithm design, implementation, Big-O notation and programming languages.

## Fidelity Technical Intern 2017
As of May 2017 I received an offer for a summer internship from Fidelity Investments as a Technical Intern. I finished it in August and walked away with a lot more diverce experience than I ever expected. In the beginning I had to research which monitoring systems would best benefit my team. Afterwards I had to experiment and see if these systems would be easy to set up and work with our existing infrastructure. At the end of the internship I had to defend my choice and explain why the system would be the ideal monitoring solution.  
## Fidelity Web Dev Technical Intern 2018
In May 2018 I received another offer from Fidelity to work as a Software Engineering intern. Throughout the summer I helped my team with web development tasks and I was proud to hear that my generic component has been approved to be used throughout the project. At the beginning of the internship I did not know anything about webdevelopment, but now I have the understanding of the webdevelopment process in the corporate world and creating websites from scratch does not seem like an arduous job anymore.

## Curu Web Developer Intern 2018
In August I got an email from the CEO of a start up that welcomed me to their technical team. This was an exciting moment for me, until this point the only experience I had was with a big company and I wasn't sure how different the pace would be here. But still I was excited to dive in and learn as much as I possibly could in the 3 months of work. I wasn't wrong, there is a lot I did not know about web development, especially when it comes to Flask. A python framework I have never used before, honestly I didn't even know people use Python for web development, that's how ignorant I was at the time. So with every project I was given, I had to do tons of StackOverflow research and YouTube tutorials to mark my project complete. Sometimes I fell flat on my face and was completely lost, but had to pick myself back up and try again. I couldn't have done it without the CTO's help, Pablo was the best mentor and manager I had the pleasure of working with.
